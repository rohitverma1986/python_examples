Key Concepts
Parent Class (Animal): The class providing the shared methods and attributes.
Child Class (Dog): The class that inherits from the parent and can add its own unique methods or override inherited ones.
super() function: This built-in function is used to call methods (especially the __init__ constructor) of the parent class from within the child class.
Method Overriding: If a method with the same name (e.g., eat()) is defined in both the parent and child classes, the child's method will be executed.
"Is-a" Relationship: Inheritance models real-world hierarchies where a Dog "is an" Animal.
